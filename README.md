# Superglue - A Chrome Extension
---

Find SuperGlue on the [Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/superglue-glue-pinned-tab/ggkhgjoafaampdpnefhhjgplgckfnohl)

This Extension allows the user to easily and intuitively save and restore pinned tabs

Watch the Advert/Tutorial to see how to do this, hopefully it should intuitively make sense. 

Thank you for supporting my work, look out for SuperGlue in the Chrome Web Store!
